## **Basics** of How the tools work 
##### Buffer Overflow Automation Tool
The Premise of the Buffer Overflow Automation Tool is to use a binary search logic algorithm to calculate the exact amount of chars that make the program overflow. This will likely be written in python, just make a PR or send me a DM on discord if you want a feature implemented or have an idea to improve it.

The Script Follows the same style as those Down below with a few modifications & Beneficial Features
