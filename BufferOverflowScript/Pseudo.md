# Psuedo

1. Input either local (handle file alloc) Or using sockets (handle socket port and address)
2. Input the Amount of Chars to init with or Automatic mode which starts with 10000
3. Start on 10000 halve the value on each iteration / take appropriate action on
4. find the cut off point

# Considerations

1. Maybe use pwntools [Check iron's writeups]
2. maybe use multiprocessing in order to maximise productivity as code awaits standard processing not user input
